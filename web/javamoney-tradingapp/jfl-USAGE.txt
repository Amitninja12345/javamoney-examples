Java Financial Library - API Usage
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Currency Functions - import net.neurotech.currency.*
-------------------------------------------------------

The API to use the JFL functions is very simple.  To convert currencies,
instantiate a Currency object and use the convert function like so:

	Currency myCur = new Currency();
	float result = Currency.convert(10, "CAD", "USD");

To get the mappings between names and symbols, get the hashtable of 
entries using:

	Lister myList = new Lister();
	Hashtable maps = Lister.getTable();
	
And then enumerate through the hash table.


Stock Quote Functions - import net.neurotech.quotes.*
-------------------------------------------------------

There are two main functions of the Quotes package inside the JFL.  To
retrieve stock quotes, use the QuoteFactory.  The first step is to
instantiate a QuoteFactory object:

	QuoteFactory qf = new QuoteFactory();

This creates a QuoteFactory that will pull it's quote information from
the default data source - Yahoo Finance.  Now to grab an actual Quote
object, use the factory like so:

	Quote microsoft = qf.getQuote("MSFT");

This method can throw a QuoteException when there's an error in the
retrieval process.

Now you can access information from the new Quote object:

	float price = microsoft.getPrice();
	long volume = microsoft.getVolume();

The other main function of the Quotes package is to search for symbols
given a company name.  First, instantiate the Searcher object:

	Searcher searcher = new Searcher();

Then use the Search method, which returns a LinkedList:

	LinkedList hits = searcher.Search("VA Research");

Note that this method will throw a SearchException if there is a problem
making the query.

Now the linked list will now contain a bunch of SearchHit objects, which
have two methods:

	searchhit.getSymbol();
	searchhit.getResult();

You can go through this list and allow the user to choose the closest
match for their search.
